Text-AI is a software which is used to predict the next word while typing. 
With our software, you can type faster. It also helps minmize the errors made while typing.

User benefits:

1) To provide a wide range of variety for the user, the model will have three suggestions for the users.
2) The selection and the rejection of these words will be stored in a database.
3) This process will make sure that the words are curated according to the user.
4) Number of times a word was used is also used to measure the efficiency of the software.
